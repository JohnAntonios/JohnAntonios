I've been programming for: [![Years Badge](https://badges.pufler.dev/years/JohnAntonios)](https://badges.pufler.dev) now, but tbh number of years mean nothing 😄.

### 🎓 Education  
I graduated from the [University of Sydney](https://www.sydney.edu.au/), completing a [Bachelor of Design Computing](https://www.sydney.edu.au/courses/courses/uc/bachelor-of-design-computing.html) from 2017 - 2020, with interdisciplinary electives in [Computer Science](https://www.sydney.edu.au/courses/subject-areas/major/computer-science3.html), [Data Science](https://www.sydney.edu.au/courses/subject-areas/major/data-science.html) and [Information Systems](https://www.sydney.edu.au/courses/subject-areas/major/information-systems2.html).

### 💼 Work 
I currently work at [uno Home Loans](https://unohomeloans.com.au) as a Frontend Developer, which is which is part of the [Westpac Group](https://www.westpac.com.au/about-westpac/westpac-group/). 
Before working at uno, I was a tutor, guest lecturer, designer and developer at the University of Sydney during my undergrad years and after graduating in 2020.

### 🏡 Outside of Work
🎵 My music taste is broad and is a mixture of mainstream and underground. Recently, I built a minimal lyric searching website known as [lyrical](https://lyrical-web.netlify.app/) which focuses on best Web performance (not to be mistaken with singing performance), practices and accessibility.
