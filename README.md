### Outside of Work 🏡
📺 I'm an avid TV and Movie watcher - as such, I've ventured off to create my own TV Show tracker which is currently being built. Check out the repo here - https://github.com/JohnAntonios/schedtv.

🎵 My music taste is broad and is a mixture of mainstream and underground. Recently, I built a minimal lyric searching website known as [lyrical](https://lyrical-web.netlify.app/) which focuses on best Web performance (not to be mistaken with singing performance), practices and accessibility.
